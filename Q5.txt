Q5.You are building a shipping application. Write a program that takes the type of package ("standard",
"express", or "overnight") and uses a switch statement to calculate and print the estimated delivery time
based on the package type. For example, "standard" might take 3-5 days, "express" 1-2 days, and
"overnight" would be delivered the next day.


function shippingApp(input){

switch (input){
    case "standard":
        console.log("Might take 3-5 days");
        break;
    case "express":
        console.log("1-2 days");
        break;
    case "overnight":
        console.log("would be delivered the next day");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Invalid package type");
        return;
    
}
}

//Test the program with different package types
shippingApp("standard");
shippingApp("express");
shippingApp("overnight");
shippingApp("Quick");

Output:

Might take 3-5 days
1-2 days
would be delivered the next day
Invalid package type
