Q4.Create a JavaScript program that takes a regex pattern and a string as input. Write a function that not
only checks if there is a match but also extracts specific parts of the matched text using groups. Test the
function with patterns that include groups to capture different parts of a date (e.g., day, month, and year)
from a given string.



function extractDateParts(pattern, inputString){
    const regex = new RegExp(pattern);
    const match = inputString.match(regex);
    
    if (match) {
        
        const groups = match.slice(1);
        
        console.log("Match found:", match[0]);
        console.log("Extracted groups:",groups);
    }else {
        console.log("No match found");
    }
    
}

const dateString1 = "Date: 2024-03-02";
const pattern1 = /Date: (\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})/;
extractDateParts(pattern1, dateString1);

const dateString2 = "Event on 15/07/2023";
const pattern2 = /Event on (\d{2})\/(\d{2})\/(\d{4})/;
extractDateParts(pattern2, dateString2);
